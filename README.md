# CLI Anti-Chess Game

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Welcome to Anti-Chess ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a CLI-based anti-chess game for two players. The rules are as follows:

- The board is the same as original chess and all the pieces have the exact same moves as original chess.
- The goal of the game is to sacrifice all your pieces before the opponent.
- If a player is in a position to take a piece, he mandatorily has to. If a player is in a position to take multiple pieces, he can decide which one to take.
- The detailed rules are there in this link: https://lichess.org/variant/antichess
- You can also try to play a few games on the same website [https://lichess.org] to understand the rules.
- You need not include the advanced rules like castling, checks, rook promotions in your solution. Just the basic moves are fine.
